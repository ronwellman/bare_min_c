# Bare Min C
This guide will serve as a document for the DCDS section to prepare for the Basic Service Level Exam (BSLE).  It is expected to grow as we identify common issues that our developers encounter or gap in their knowledge.  It is not expected to be an all encompassing guide to the C programming language. Below is a rough idea of the topics that will be covered.  Topics may or may not survive in this order or at all.
